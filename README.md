# CPSC406-Chess-Project <br/>
## Install Stockfish
    sudo apt-get install stockfish
## Install python chess library
    pip3 install chess

## source venv/bin/activate

## Run the program
Right now, I think this only works for linux distros.  You need to install stockfish using the command above (or similar one if you don't have apt-get)
If you have stockfish in a different location than '/usr/games/stockfish' you can update board_position to match yours.
Install the requirements in requirements.txt
