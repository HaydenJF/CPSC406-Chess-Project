# CPSC406-Chess-Project <br/>
## Install Stockfish
    sudo apt-get install stockfish
## Install python chess library
    pip3 install chess

## Run the program
    To run the program you need to have stockfish installed.
    The main thing you have to do is run main.py at python 3.10.6.
    It is a flask application with a custom port so make sure you have nothing else running on port 5005.
    Right now the backend isn't completely connected to the front end so it is a little broken.  This will be fixed by next Friday..
