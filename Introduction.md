In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, artificial intelligence has become a regular part of our lives, revolutionizing various fields and industries. Specifically, one area where AI has made significant strides is strategic board games, such as chess. Chess has long been regarded as the ultimate test of strategic thinking and decision-making, and the advent of AI has introduced a new dimension to this age-old game.
Our group, comprised of various skill levels in chess, has chosen to embark on the project of creating an explainable chess AI with Stockfish. Our decision to work on this project stems from our shared love for chess and our keen interest in exploring the potential of AI. We are driven by the desire to develop work on the AI system to modify its exhibits in order to provide understandable explanations for its moves, making it accessible to expert players and novices.
Chess has always just been a game to us. However throughout this journey it has shown us how it embodies the perfect blend of art, science, and strategy. The complexities inherent in chess positions and the countless possibilities that unfold with each move challenge our analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. By leveraging the power of AI, we aim to enhance these skills even further.
The choice to use Stockfish as the foundation for our chess AI project is driven by its well-established reputation as one of the most substantial chess engines in the world. Stockfish is an open-source engine known for superior positional understanding, and strength in analyzing complex chess positions. By building upon Stockfish, we can tap into its algorithms and leverage its extensive knowledge base to create a formidable AI coach/assistant.
However, while Stockfish is undoubtedly a powerful chess engine, its decision-making process can often seem difficult to comprehend for human players. This lack of explainability can be a significant barrier for players who want to understand the rationale behind the AI's moves and learn from its strategies. Our project aims to bridge this gap by enhancing Stockfish's explainability, allowing players to gain insights into AI decision-making for the profit of build skills out of it.
Through this project, we seek to make the world of chess and AI more accessible and engaging for a broader audience. By developing an explainable chess AI, we can provide players with an educational tool that challenges their skills and enhances their understanding of the game. Our passion for chess and AI drives us to explore the frontiers of this exciting intersection, unlocking new possibilities for both the chess community and the AI field/industry.
