While not necessarily changing the algorithm itself, we will introduce the ability for the AI to communicate effectively with the user such that it becomes a tool for learning. As it is currently, Stockfish is a powerful engine that uses alpha-beta pruning(explained later on) to improve the minimax function in order to reduce the number of possible variations of the game to evaluate. This is done using a number of techniques and heuristics, such as forward pruning and iterative deepening.
Alpha-beta pruning is a robust search algorithm used in game trees to improve the efficiency of the minimax algorithm, which is commonly employed in decision-making processes for games like chess. It works by significantly reducing the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, thus saving computational resources and speeding up the search.
In chess, alpha-beta pruning eliminates the evaluation of branches in the game tree that are determined to be irrelevant or less promising based on previously evaluated moves. It maintains two values: alpha, representing the maximum lower bound on the possible score for the maximizing player (e.g., white), and beta, representing the minimum upper bound on the possible score for the minimizing player (e.g., black). As the algorithm traverses the game tree, it updates these values, discarding branches outside the alpha-beta bounds.
Research supports the effectiveness of alpha-beta pruning in significantly reducing the number of evaluated nodes in game trees. For instance, a study titled "Deep Blue" by Campbell et al. (2002) highlights the usage of alpha-beta pruning as a crucial component in IBM's Deep Blue chess-playing supercomputer. The authors emphasize that Deep Blue's search algorithms, including alpha-beta pruning, allowed it to efficiently explore the vast number of possible moves and positions in chess games, contributing to its excellent gameplay and success against world champion Garry Kasparov.
Despite the impressive capabilities of Stockfish as an AI chess engine, its primary purpose is to solve chess games rather than serve as a learning tool. As John von Newmann famously stated, "Chess is not a game. Chess is a well-defined form of computation... there must be a solution, a right procedure in any position." Stockfish embodies this philosophy, focusing on providing optimal moves based on exhaustive analysis rather than facilitating the learning process.
To address this limitation and fulfill our goal of integrating Stockfish with educational features, we aim to enhance its functionality to serve as a teaching tool. Currently, when Stockfish is integrated into popular chess platforms like chess.com, the visualization is simplistic, offering binary evaluations such as "right" or "wrong," "blunder" or "perfect." However, Stockfish's innate capabilities allow it to foresee the consequences of various moves, enabling us to provide visualizations that illustrate the outcomes of user moves.
Moreover, Stockfish possesses the ability to analyze positions from both perspectives, considering the moves of both the user and the opponent. By utilizing this feature, we can visualize the potential consequences of the opponent's moves as well, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the game dynamics. The notion of "seeing into the future" using Stockfish is not to predict every possible outcome, as the number of legal chess games exceeds 10^40. Instead, Stockfish operates by evaluating the outcomes of chess moves through a tree data structure.
Given the vast number of potential moves, Stockfish employs algorithms like alpha-beta pruning to narrow down the options it needs to evaluate. It assigns scores to positions, representing the advantage for either side (positive for white pieces and negative for black pieces). However, it is crucial to note that Stockfish calculates based on optimal play and is not designed to guide players to victory without relying on the engine entirely.
Every move in a chess game represents a problem of action and consequence, and Stockfish's algorithm considers the correctness of moves at every stage of every potential game. While it is not possible for Stockfish to analyze every combination of moves due to the immense number of possibilities, it still offers valuable insights by exploring a significant portion of the decision tree.
By leveraging Stockfish's computational power and enhancing its teaching capabilities, we aim to provide users with a tool that not only offers optimal moves but also facilitates a deeper understanding of the game. Our project seeks to bridge the gap between AI analysis and human learning, enabling players to make informed decisions based on the consequences of their moves. Through this endeavor, we hope to empower chess enthusiasts to improve their skills, broaden their strategic thinking, and appreciate the intricacies of the game on a more profound level.
An ideal product would be a program that is able to integrate the ability of Stockfish with the ability to teach effectively. While this can take many different forms, we think the most important concepts to integrate are the concepts of your own vulnerability in regard to your pieces, the strength of certain pieces on the board, and the importance of endgames. This is in addition to basic things, such as fundamental rules.
For example, let's say that our player is the white pieces.  This means that positive numbers from stockfish mean the most optimal move.  Let's say our player is looking at two possible moves.  After the other player plays, our player has 4 possible moves they can play.  From these moves on set 1 the player has scores: {15, -5, -5, -2} and in set 2 the players possible scores are {4, 3, 7, -1}.  Stockfish would recommend our player play option 1 because in set 1 there is the highest likely move to win the game.  However, humans arenâ€™t perfect AI and tend to make mistakes.  If the player were to choose a move randomly then there is a 25% chance of a good move in set 1 and a 75% chance of a good move in set 2.  So move 2 would be the better move for a more novice player.
